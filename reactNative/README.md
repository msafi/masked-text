# React Native Input Mask

&#x1F6A7; **This component is experimental**. It works but it's not production-ready yet.

## Getting started

First, install it.

```bash
npm i react-native-text-mask --save
```

Then, require it and use it.

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react'
import {View} from 'react-native'
import MaskedInput from 'react-native-text-mask'

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <MaskedInput mask={['(', /[1-9]/, /\d/, /\d/, ')', ' ', /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, '-', /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, /\d/]} />
      </View>
    )
  }
}
```

`<MaskedInput/>` is fully compatible with the `<TextInput/>` element. So, you can
pass any style, a placeholder attribute, and all other `TextInput` props.

For example, the following works:

```js
<MaskedInput
  mask={['(', /[1-9]/, /\d/, /\d/, ')', ' ', /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, '-', /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, /\d/]}
  placeholder="Enter a phone number"
/>
```
